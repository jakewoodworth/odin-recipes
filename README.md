This is my introductory project to HTML for the Odin Project. I used a variety of HTML tags to create a simple recipe website that includes multiple recipe pages linked from a main index page. Each recipe page contains a title, image, description, list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions. The project demonstrates my understanding of HTML structure, semantic elements, and linking between pages. I learned how to organize content effectively and create a user-friendly navigation experience. The project serves as a foundation for further exploration of web development concepts.
