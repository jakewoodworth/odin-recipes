    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Steak frites is a classic dish that pairs a well-seared steak with crispy fries for a simple but satisfying meal. The focus is on high-quality ingredients and proper cooking technique rather than complex preparation. A rich sauce or herb butter is often served alongside the steak to enhance its flavor.    </p>
    <p>
        This dish balances crispy, golden fries with tender, juicy steak, making it both hearty and elegant. Steak frites is commonly enjoyed as a restaurant-style meal but can be made at home with minimal ingredients and careful timing.    </p>
