    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Spaghetti Carbonara is a traditional Italian pasta dish known for its rich, creamy texture made without cream. The sauce is created by combining eggs, cheese, and hot pasta, which come together to form a smooth coating on the noodles. Crispy pork and freshly cracked black pepper add depth and balance to the dish.
