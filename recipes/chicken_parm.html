    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken Parmesan is a classic Italian-American comfort dish made with
        breaded chicken cutlets that are pan-fried until golden and topped with
        warm marinara sauce and melted cheese. This version focuses on simple
        ingredients and straightforward steps to create a crispy, flavorful
        meal without unnecessary complexity.

    <p>
        The chicken is coated in seasoned breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese,
        giving it a crunchy exterior while staying juicy inside. Finished in
        the oven, the dish brings together savory tomato sauce, gooey melted
        mozzarella, and fresh herbs, making it perfect for a hearty weeknight
        dinner or a casual gathering.
